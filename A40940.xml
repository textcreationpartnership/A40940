         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">John 1.</note> And the <hi>Teachers</hi> of the world ſaith, that Chriſt hath not enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned every man that is come into the world, whenas the Scripture ſaith he doth, and <hi>Iohn</hi> bare witneſs to it that he did, and thus they are er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the ſpirit that gave forth the Scriptures, ſhewing the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a ſpirit of error.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Teachers</hi> of the world have told us, that the ſteeplehouſe is the Church, which was in the dayes of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> a place for all her <hi>Ieſuit Prieſts,</hi> and the made a Decree, that whoſoever did diſturb any of her <hi>Prieſts</hi> in the time of their ſervice, whileſt they was at their <hi>Maſs</hi> or <hi>Miniſtring,</hi> as they call it, in their <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Church-yard;</hi> or did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face any <hi>Croſs</hi> or <hi>Crucifix,</hi> they was to ſuffer three months impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſhe was called a <hi>Defender of the Faith</hi> who gave forth this Decree, which is quite contrary to Scripture and Faith, as you may read, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. which ſaith, <hi>You may all propheſie one by one,</hi>

               <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 1.1. 1 Cor. 14.30.</note> and the practiſe of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God and the Church diſturbs the Miniſters of the World, now in our dayes, as it did the Papiſt Prieſts, which makes them priſon and perſecute, manifeſting the ſpirit of Error.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Teachers</hi> of the world told us, that <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi> is the two <hi>Fountains,</hi> and thoſe was the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Chriſt that came from thence, which we ſee, through the mercy of the Lord,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.</note> that they are the Miniſters of the world, made by the will of man, and ſo are contrary to the Scriptures, ſhewing the Spirit of Error.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Teachers</hi> of the world told us, that they was Miniſters of God, and they was to open the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and yet they told us they had not that ſpirit that gave forth the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> ſo then another, the Spirit of Error.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Teachers</hi> of the world told us, they was <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Chriſt, and they do take <hi>Tithes</hi> of men, and if they will not give it them,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.3.

            <p>The <hi>Teachers</hi> of the world do manifeſt themſelves to be in the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, for how many Goals in the Nation are the Servants of God caſt

            <p>Did ever any perſecute that was in <hi>Abels</hi> faith, whom God hath reſpect to, but ſuch <hi>teachers</hi> as goes in <hi>Cains</hi> way, &amp; <hi>Balaams</hi> way, as you may read in <hi>Iude</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> and is not here marks of the worlds <hi>Teachers,</hi> that all the honeſt hearted may ſee, that fear God, by their fruits and marks which they themſelves do manifeſt. And do not they manifeſt themſelves to be the <hi>bryars</hi> and the <hi>thorns</hi> where the <hi>Grapes</hi> and <hi>Figs</hi> grows not? And do the <hi>Teachers</hi> of the world manifeſt themſelves to be the ravening Wolves, which have gotten the <hi>Sheeps clothing,</hi> and by their means many of <hi>Chriſts ſheep</hi> are caſt into priſons, and there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt murdered, and they have made many of the Magiſtrates with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the fear of God, to be their Executioners, to caſt the Lambs of Chriſt into priſon, but ſuch as fear God, ſee their folly, and the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the wicked <hi>Teachers</hi> are too many to mention.</p>
            <p>Again, ſuch Prieſts as preached for hire, and Prophets that divined for money, and Heads that judged for rewards, <hi>theſe built up Zion with blood, and Ieruſalem with iniquity, therefore ſhall Zion for your ſakes be laid waſt, and plowed as a field, and Ieruſalem ſhall become as heaps, and the Mountain of the houſe ſhall be as the forreſt:</hi> and all conſider that be in the Light, if this Nation be not brought to the ſame paſs by theſe builders which are now cryed againſt with the Light that <hi>Micah was</hi> in;<note place="margin">Mich. 3.9, 10 11.</note> but them which be in the error hold up them which be in the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, but them which be in the Light cannot hold up them which be in the error, neither ever could in all ages, but the Light did them judg and condemn, in which Light the Saints have their Unity, both with the Son and the Father: and this was given forth that all may take warning in their life time what they hold up.</p>
